# Testcase Example:  '[2,3,1,1,4]'
#
# You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the
# array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum
# jump length at that position.
#
# Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
# Output: true
# Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
# Output: false
# Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum
# jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
# 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
#
#
