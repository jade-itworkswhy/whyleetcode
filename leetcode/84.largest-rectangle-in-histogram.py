#
# Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height
# where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in
# the histogram.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
# Output: 10
# Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
# The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10
# units.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: heights = [2,4]
# Output: 4
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= heights.length <= 10^5
# 0 <= heights[i] <= 10^4
#
#
