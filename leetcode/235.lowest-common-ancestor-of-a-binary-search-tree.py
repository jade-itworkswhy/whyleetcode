#
# Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node
# of two given nodes in the BST.
#
# According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor
# is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p
# and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of
# itself).”
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant
# of itself according to the LCA definition.
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
# Output: 2
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 10^5].
# -10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9
# All Node.val are unique.
# p != q
# p and q will exist in the BST.
#
#
