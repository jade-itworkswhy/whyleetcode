# Testcase Example:  '[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]'
#
# Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width
# of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array
# [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section)
# are being trapped.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
# Output: 9
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# n == height.length
# 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
# 0 <= height[i] <= 10^5
#
#

class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: list[int]) -> int:
        if not height:
            return 0

        l, r = 0, len(height) - 1
        leftMax, rightMax = height[l], height[r]
        res = 0
        while l < r:
            if leftMax < rightMax:
                l += 1
                leftMax = max(leftMax, height[l])
                res += leftMax - height[l]
            else:
                r -= 1
                rightMax = max(rightMax, height[r])
                res += rightMax - height[r]
        return res
